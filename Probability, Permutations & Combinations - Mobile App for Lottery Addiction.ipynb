    "The app idea comes from a medical institute which is specialized in treating gambling addictions. The institute already has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities. For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that can answer users the following questions:\n",

    "1. What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "2. What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",

    "In the 6/49 lottery, six numbers are drawn from a set of 49 numbers that range from 1 to 49. A player wins the big prize if the six numbers on their tickets match all the six numbers drawn.
